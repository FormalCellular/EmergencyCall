Finished computing initial states: 32768 distinct states generated at 2020-06-12 18:37:15.
Progress(4) at 2020-06-12 18:37:18: 806,172 states generated (806,172 s/min), 247,878 distinct states found (247,878 ds/min), 76,580 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 4.2E-6
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.1E-6
23650304 states generated, 3932160 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 19.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 5 and the 95th percentile is 4).
