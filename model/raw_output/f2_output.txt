Finished computing initial states: 24576 distinct states generated at 2020-06-12 18:40:53.
Progress(3) at 2020-06-12 18:40:56: 514,723 states generated (514,723 s/min), 240,399 distinct states found (240,399 ds/min), 148,796 states left on queue.
Progress(12) at 2020-06-12 18:41:56: 24,295,235 states generated (23,780,512 s/min), 4,579,099 distinct states found (4,338,700 ds/min), 664,868 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.1E-5
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 2.6E-7
39053696 states generated, 6248960 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 25.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 7 and the 95th percentile is 5).
